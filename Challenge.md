# The Challenge

Your team have been contracted by the board of directors of your chosen company in your chosen industry to carry out a large-scale audit of the organization operating in the chosen industry, with a view towards future proofing their organization. Your team may choose any public limited company with over \$5bn of revenue operating in the list of five industries provided as follows:

1.  Air travel
2.  Healthcare
3.  Logistics
4.  Recruitment
5.  Retail

We would like you to produce a comprehensive report on our firm, focusing on our biggest opportunities to future-proof our organisation. This report will then be summarised in a brief presentation to our board, followed by a Q&A session with the directors. We are expecting you to suggest a minimum of two emerging technologies that could be leveraged to future-proof our organisation. We are also expecting you to prototype any app-based solution you create.

## Customer Experience Enhancement:

1.  Journey Mapping: Produce a map the typical customer journey touchpoints, analysing pain points and opportunities for improvements. This should include the customer journey from acquisition to post-product delivery.
2.  Experience Enhancement: Create a custom app will improve customer experience.

**This app should focus on at least one aspect of the customer journey.**

This section of the report should be accompanied by an App prototype.

## What parts of the app journey are problematic?

In the above industries, after we acquire a customer, what are their problems? And what are the threats that may cause them to likely leave us? Can we create a technological solution to drive customer retention?

I'll start, but help me fill these up...
